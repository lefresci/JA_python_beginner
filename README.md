These projects I've made during my python beginner course at JetBrains Academy

creditcalc.py 

This script can assist you in calculating loan parameters such as annuities, differential payments, principal, and interest rates. 
It made use of the argparse module, so you can use it directly from terminal. 


hangman.py

This is a game that I've made during my Python Beginner course at JetBrains Academy.


game.py

This is a pencil game. If you take the last pencil, you will lose. You are John, and you should defeat the bot Jack. 
Jack plays very well and won`t leave you a chance.
